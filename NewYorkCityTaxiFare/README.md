bout the repository

The goal here is use the Tensorflow API and create a end-to-end project, from data loading to model predictions, and use the Kaggle "New York City Taxi Fare Prediction competition" as the data source.
What you will find

    Data preprocessing and cleaning using the "csv" library. [link]
    Data batch loading using Tensorflow. [link]
    Preprocess each batch by time with Tensorflow. [link]

New York City Taxi Fare Prediction
Can you predict a rider's taxi fare?

Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction
Overview

In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels). Your challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!
