## Predicting calories with machine learning
### Introduction

In this notebook we will use machine learning and regression models to train and fit the data

### Dataset

The dataset is taken from Kaggle.com and composed of:
* Exercise Dataset
* Calories Dataset

### Objective

The objective is to determine the best regression model that can predict teh calories spent given input features.
The aim is to use `Scikit Library` and the models that come with it
